<!-- Towards a more useful fixed-point number class
Turn-in directory: ex01/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, Fixed.{h, hpp}, Fixed.cpp
Allowed functions: roundf (from <cmath>)


The previous exercise was a good start, but our class is pretty useless. It can only
represent the value 0.0.
Add the following public constructors and public member functions to your class:

<!-- • A constructor that takes a constant integer as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value
should be initialized to 8, like in exercise 00.

• A constructor that takes a constant floating-point number as a parameter.
It converts it to the corresponding fixed-point value. The fractional bits value
should be initialized to 8, like in exercise 00. -->

<!-- • A member function float toFloat( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to a floating-point value.

• A member function int toInt( void ) const;
that converts the fixed-point value to an integer value.

And add the following function to the Fixed class files:
• An overload of the insertion («) operator that inserts a floating-point representation
of the fixed-point number into the output stream object passed as a parameter. --> 

Add public member functions to your class to overload the following operators:
• The 6 comparison operators: >, <, >=, <=, ==, and !=.
• The 4 arithmetic operators: +, -, *, and /.
• The 4 increment/decrement (pre-increment and post-increment, pre-decrement and
post-decrement) operators, which will increase or decrease the fixed-point value by
the smallest representable ϵ, such that 1 + ϵ > 1.

Add these four public overloaded member functions to your class:

• A static member function min that takes two references to fixed-point numbers as
parameters, and returns a reference to the smallest one.

• A static member function min that takes two references to constant fixed-point
numbers as parameters, and returns a reference to the smallest one.

• A static member function max that takes two references to fixed-point numbers as
parameters, and returns a reference to the greatest one.

• A static member function max that takes two references to constant fixed-point
numbers as parameters, and returns a reference to the greatest one.
