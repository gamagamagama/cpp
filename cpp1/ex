Exercise 04: Sed is for losers
Exercise : 04
Sed is for losers
Turn-in directory: ex04/
Files to turn in: Makefile, main.cpp, *.cpp, *.{h, hpp}
Forbidden functions: std::string::replace

Create a program that takes three parameters in the following order: a filename and
two strings, s1 and s2.
It must open the file <filename> and copy its content into a new file
<filename>.replace, replacing every occurrence of s1 with s2.
Using C file manipulation functions is forbidden and will be considered cheating. All
the member functions of the class std::string are allowed, except replace. Use them
wisely!
Of course, handle unexpected inputs and errors. You must create and turn in your
own tests to ensure that your program works as expected.

Constructors and Assignment

string() - Default constructor
string(const string& str) - Copy constructor
string(const char* s) - C-string constructor
operator=() - Assignment operators

Element Access

at(size_t pos) - Access character with bounds checking
operator[](size_t pos) - Access character without bounds checking
data() - Get pointer to underlying character array
c_str() - Get C-style null-terminated string

Iterators

begin(), cbegin() - Iterator to beginning
end(), cend() - Iterator to end
rbegin(), crbegin() - Reverse iterator to beginning
rend(), crend() - Reverse iterator to end

Capacity

empty() - Check if string is empty
size(), length() - Get string length
max_size() - Get maximum possible size
reserve(size_t n) - Reserve storage
capacity() - Get current capacity

Modifiers

clear() - Clear contents
insert() - Insert characters
erase() - Erase characters
push_back(char c) - Append character
append() - Append to string
operator+=() - Append operator
assign() - Assign content
//replace() - Replace portion of string
swap() - Swap contents
resize() - Change size

String Operations

substr(size_t pos, size_t len) - Get substring
copy() - Copy substring to character array
find() - Find substring/character
rfind() - Find last occurrence
find_first_of() - Find first occurrence of any character
find_last_of() - Find last occurrence of any character
find_first_not_of() - Find first absence of character
find_last_not_of() - Find last absence of character
compare() - Compare strings

Non-member Functions (commonly used with strings)

operator+ - Concatenation
operator==, operator!=, operator<, etc. - Comparison operators
getline() - Read line from stream
These are the most commonly used member functions. The exact availability may depend on your C++ standard version.
